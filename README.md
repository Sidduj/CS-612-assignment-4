# Data Science Articles

It is a Single Page Application for articles regarding data science
I've added 3 articles' summary on the home page. Each of this 3 posts contain title, date and
summary of the original blog post. The summary is wrapped around an image.
The title of blogs are linked to the original main blog.
After clicking on the title we will be redirected to the main blog posts which will also
display date and the same image, that will replace the home page.

The Navigation bar will have Homepage button which will redirect us to home page.
You can use this button after reading the whole blog to go back to home page.
The Navigation bar also displays Google's Top headlines, which is done by using API.
It displays the title, description and link to full story.
